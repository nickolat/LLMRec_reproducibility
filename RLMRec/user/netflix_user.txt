You will serve as an assistant to help me determine which types of movies a specific user is likely to enjoy.
I will provide you with information about movies that the user has seen.
Here are the instructions:
1. Each seen movie will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes:
{
    "title": "the title of the movie",
    "year": "the year of the movie" (if there are no categories, I will set this value to "nan")
}

2. The information I will give you:
SEEN MOVIES: a list of JSON strings describing the movies that the user has seen.

Requirements:
1. Please provide your decision in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "profile": "A summarization of what types of movies this user is likely to enjoy" (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None"),
    "reasoning": "briefly explain your reasoning for the summarization"
}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 100 words.
3. The "reasoning" has no word limits.
4. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string.
